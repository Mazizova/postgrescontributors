about: "I’m from Ecuador, a little country in South America, a nice place to visit with beaches and highlands, jungles and big cities too… especially I will recommend anyone to visit the Galapagos Islands. I’m also a Chilean citizen because of my dad and have a little percentage of Italian blood because of my mom’s grandfather.I have 18 years working and contributing with PostgreSQL, at least half of them leading the Ecuador branch of 2ndQuadrant. After EDB’s acquisition of 2ndQ, we reverted to our original name of SYSTEMGUARDS, of which I am the CEO, a PostgreSQL support company that specializes in spanish language support, consultancy and training."
