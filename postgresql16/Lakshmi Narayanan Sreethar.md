about: "I have a decade of experience working in the development of distributed, highly available, in-memory databases, with a focus on MySQL Cluster and PostgreSQL. I am skilled in C/C++, Go, Kubernetes, Linux, Data Structures and Algorithms, and have a strong background in Database and Information Retrieval. I recently led the design and development of a Go Kubernetes Operator for MySQL Cluster, which is now available on Github. I also contributed to the integration of the new Data Dictionary and the Foreign Key schema handling of the Ndbcluster plugin for MySQL 8.0. I enjoy working on challenging and innovative projects that solve real-world problems and improve database performance and scalability."
