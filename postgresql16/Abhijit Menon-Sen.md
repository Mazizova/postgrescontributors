about: "I’ve submitted bug fixes and feature patches of varying size to Postgres for many years, and I’ve been involved with many other projects in the wider ecosystem, e.g., I was a repmgr maintainer, I’m the technical lead for Barman now, and I’ve contributed to many extensions etc.I feel very fortunate to have used and contributed to Postgres in so many different ways over the majority of my working life, and I really value the productive working relationships I’ve built with many other contributors during that time."
