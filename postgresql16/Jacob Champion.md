about: "I'm a software engineer with more than a decade of experience in creating and maintaining web-based distributed systems. I can architect new systems to minimize security risk, analyze existing ones for potential vulnerabilities, and recommend appropriate courses of action when vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered. My particular areas of expertise include application design for embedded and resource-constrained environments, as well as the maintenance and end-of-life management of legacy systems and protocols.I've contributed to the code bases of major open-source web servers and database engines in a variety of languages. I'm comfortable working in Agile project management systems, and I've acted as ScrumMaster and team lead for small teams of engineers. And I don't shy away from janitorial work when old code just needs to be cleaned up."
