about: "I have been working with PostgreSQL since version 6.5.3 and year 1999. Since then, I used every released, and most developer versions, including latest snapshots from GIT repository of PostgreSQL project.My work, initially just working with databases, over time focused more and more on the database end of applications. This transition also reaffirmed my trust in my database of choice, its features, stability and developers know-how."
