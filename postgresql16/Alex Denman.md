about: "As a researcher, I was repeatedly confronted with situations where the available tools for data processing and analysis were not sufficient to the task, so I learned how to make my own. Working with MATLAB, PostgreSQL, and various application-specific scripting languages, I designed a variety of data management and analysis tools, which remain in use by other lab personnel."
