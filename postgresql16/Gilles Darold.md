about: "I am a PostgreSQL Database Administrator and Developer. I've been working in the world of PostgreSQL and Linux for over 20 years and have worked on many different projects covering PostgreSQL administration, performance tuning, advanced backup and recovery, replication, and high Availability. I have also 20 years of experiences in different areas related to System and Network. I use PostgreSQL since 1995, since this time I've created some well known tools around PostgreSQL like pgBadger for log analysis, Ora2Pg to migrate Oracle database and more recently pgCluu, pgFormatter and some useful PostgreSQL extensions. I've also contributed to PostgreSQL, pgPool-II and OpenLDAP code to name a few."
