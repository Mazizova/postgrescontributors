about: "My core experience is Automotive Dealership Database Modelling in PostgreSQL. Because PostgreSQL has been my selfless and constant companion, much of my recent public wanderings have been focused on aiding the community surrounding it. Primarily in answering questions and making suggestions, but also submitting and reviewing patches to the core project."
