about: "I've always been interested in software design methodologies and paradigms. During my university experience I studied the above methodologies, as well as MAS systems. Moreover, I had the chance to teach students about such methodologies, as well as MAS, Java and Unix programming (C and Bourne Shell). In my current work I do database and network administration, as well as Linux and FreeBSD system administration. I'm also interested in new technologies and how they can help migration and integration of legacy systems."
