about: "Having worked with all the major commercial relational databases as an application developer in data-heavy industries like fintech over a couple of decades, I am under no illusions about the fact that each of them can beat PostgreSQL in some respect or other. But PostgreSQL is my favouriteâ€¦ it belongs to all of us and we have the power to keep making it better!"
