github: "I’m a PostgreSQL developer and I work for the Cybertec company. In my previous job I was a DBA of some DB2 servers and I was always curious how databases work from the inside. Thus I naturally became interested in open source databases. And since PostgreSQL is declared to be the most advanced open source database, I focussed on it. When working on a feature that needs to be split into multiple diff files, I create one branch per diff and use a shell script to compare the “adjacent” branches and to generate the diffs. Other scripts take care of merging (both local and upstream) changes into the individual branches. "
