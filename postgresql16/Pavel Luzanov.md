about: "My first project after joining Postgres Pro was to translate the PostgreSQL documentation into Russian. After all, I started translating it even before I joined the company. But itâ€™s one thing to translate a couple of chapters and quite another to translate the entire documentation. In the beginning, we tried different approaches to translation, but things got pretty slow. But then Alexander Lakhin came to the company. He is an incredible person. He translates with amazing speed and quality. Alexander not only translated the entire documentation for 9.4 to completion, he has been updating the documentation for new versions every year since. Now I am sure he is almost done with version 14."
