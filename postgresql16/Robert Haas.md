about: "I am a PostgreSQL major contributor and committer. PostgreSQL features which I have authored or coauthored include unlogged tables, fast-path locking, index-only scans, and parallel query. PostgreSQL features written by others which I have reviewed and committed include partitioning, logical decoding, event triggers, and foreign tables. I work at EnterpriseDB as VP, Chief Database Architect, managing a team which is responsible for both Advanced Server, EnterpriseDB's flagship database product, and for our company's ongoing contributions to PostgreSQL. My team is great, and PostgreSQL is awesome!"
