about: "After two years of hard work, I managed to graduate from OMSCS. It was challenging to balance both work and study simultaneously, but it provided me with a valuable opportunity to explore various areas of computer science. Although this marks the completion of my graduate studies, I remain eager to continue my learning journey."
