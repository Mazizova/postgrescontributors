about: "After I turned forty, or thereabouts, I started to get an itch for a new professional direction. I had some options yet I decided to go for a long shot and return to engineering from management. There was a project that always fascinated me yet I didn’t know in depth, postgres. I was fortunate to be hired to work remotely as an engineer on Greenplum by Pivotal. Following Pivotal’s acquisition by VMware, I moved to the postgres team where I now reside."
