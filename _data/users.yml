  github: "I’m a PostgreSQL developer and I work for the Cybertec company. In my previous job I was a DBA of some DB2 servers and I was always curious how databases work from the inside. Thus I naturally became interested in open source databases. And since PostgreSQL is declared to be the most advanced open source database, I focussed on it. When working on a feature that needs to be split into multiple diff files, I create one branch per diff and use a shell script to compare the “adjacent” branches and to generate the diffs. Other scripts take care of merging (both local and upstream) changes into the individual branches. "

  about: "My first project after joining Postgres Pro was to translate the PostgreSQL documentation into Russian. After all, I started translating it even before I joined the company. But it’s one thing to translate a couple of chapters and quite another to translate the entire documentation. In the beginning, we tried different approaches to translation, but things got pretty slow. But then Alexander Lakhin came to the company. He is an incredible person. He translates with amazing speed and quality. Alexander not only translated the entire documentation for 9.4 to completion, he has been updating the documentation for new versions every year since. Now I am sure he is almost done with version 14."
